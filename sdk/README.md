# StackBlitz SDK

Wouldn't it be great if you could create StackBlitz projects on-demand from your docs, examples, blog posts?

This is exactly what the StackBlitz SDK allows you to do. Even better, the SDK even gives you full control of the StackBlitz VM - allowing you to build rich & interactive experiences around your projects. ðŸ˜® ðŸ™Œ

The SDK is **2kb gzipped** (!) and you can install it from npm:

```sh
npm install --save @stackblitz/sdk
```

Or add a script tag to the UMD build on jsDelivr/Unpkg â€” the SDK will be available on `window` as `StackBlitzSDK`:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@stackblitz/sdk/bundles/sdk.umd.js"></script>
```
